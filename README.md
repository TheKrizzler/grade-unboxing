# Grade Unboxing

A Chrome extension that hides grades on https://fsweb.no/studentweb/resultater.jsf and replaces them with a CS:GO-style case-opening animation. This project is 100% vibe coded by the way, I have done practically nothing.

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `grade-unboxing` folder.
4. Navigate to https://fsweb.no/studentweb/resultater.jsf and log in.

## How it works

- Each grade is replaced with an "Open case" button.
- Clicking the button opens an overlay with a scrolling animation of grade cards.
- The animation builds suspense and reveals your actual grade with a celebration effect.
- Close the overlay anytime by clicking "Reveal" or pressing Escape.

## Description

Unlock Your Potential — One Grade at a Time.

Imagine opening your report card the same way you crack open a high-stakes case drop.
The anticipation.
The tension.
The slow roll from “Common” to “Maybe-Just-Maybe-Something-Insane.”

With Academic Case Opener for Chrome, your grades become more than numbers on a page — they become items of value, rare pulls, coveted outcomes. Every test, every assignment, every semester becomes a case opening session waiting to happen. You click. You wait. The reel spins. Your GPA becomes loot.

No more emotionless scrolling through school portals. No more flat, sterile grade tables.
Now every result carries risk, weight, and reward.
Did you land a stat-track Legendary A?
Or did the case flash gold then betrayal-drop to a Battle-Scarred C-?
You’ll never know until it opens — and you’ll feel every second of it.

This extension transforms routine academic checking into a moment that matters.
It’s suspense.
It’s adrenaline.
It’s a parody of gambling merged with the chaos of education — turning progress tracking into a full-scale emotional gamble.

Perfect for students who want school to feel like a loot table and grades to carry the gravity of a knife drop.
