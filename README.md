# Grade Unboxing

A Chrome extension that hides grades on https://fsweb.no/studentweb/resultater.jsf and replaces them with a CS:GO-style case-opening animation.

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `grade-unboxing` folder.
4. Navigate to https://fsweb.no/studentweb/resultater.jsf and log in.

## How it works

- Each grade is replaced with an "Open case" button.
- Clicking the button opens an overlay with a scrolling animation of grade cards.
- The animation builds suspense and reveals your actual grade with a celebration effect.
- Close the overlay anytime by clicking "Reveal" or pressing Escape.
